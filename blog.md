# My day at the beach
>The crab looked at me with fear. He knew he was delicious - he had to know.

Today I went to the beach. I collected a lot of different shells. Some of the shells I found are:
* Cowrie shells
* A weird big conch
* _A whole intact crab shell_

Actually - that last one was not just a shell. There was a **living crab** still inside. I picked it up he remained perfectly still - until his beady eyes swivelled around on their stalks to examine me. The crab looked at me with fear. He knew he was delicious - he had to know. I saw a seagull sitting on a nearby rock, examining the situation, no doubt thinking the very same thing.

I couldn't deal with the pressure, and I tossed the crab out into the water.

Godspeed, crab.
